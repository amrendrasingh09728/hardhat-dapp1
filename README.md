# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

I tried to create a basic hardhat project.
In this project i tried to take input from user and print that value on screen using hardhat local blockchain and react app.
